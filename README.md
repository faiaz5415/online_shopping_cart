# üõí Online Shopping Cart System

This Dart-based command-line application simulates a basic online shopping cart experience. Users can browse a selection of products, add items to their cart, and ultimately view a detailed bill reflecting quantities and total costs. It's a straightforward demonstration of fundamental programming concepts in Dart.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Product Catalog Display:** Presents a clear list of available products along with their respective prices to the user.
* **Interactive Cart Management:** Allows users to input choices to add desired items to their shopping cart.
* **Quantity Management:** Intelligently handles scenarios where the same product is added multiple times, automatically updating the quantity rather than adding duplicate entries.
* **Dynamic Total Calculation:** At the time of checkout, the system calculates and displays the grand total price of all items in the cart.
* **Core Programming Concepts:** Built using fundamental programming constructs such as basic functions for modularity, list operations for managing products and cart items, and essential control flow (like loops and if-else statements) for managing user interaction and logic.

## üì¶ Technologies Used

* **Dart:** The primary programming language used for developing the shopping cart system.
* **List & Map:** Utilizes Dart's `List` for ordered collections (e.g., storing products or cart items) and `Map` for key-value pairs (e.g., product details with prices).
* **Functions:** Employs functions to encapsulate specific functionalities, promoting code reusability and organization.
* **Looping & if-else control flow:** Makes extensive use of `for` or `while` loops for iterating through collections and `if-else` statements for conditional logic (e.g., checking user input, managing quantities).
